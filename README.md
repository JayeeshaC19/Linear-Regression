***Linear regression teaches us: sometimes the best answers lie in straight lines***

The comp-activ database comprises activity measures of computer systems. Data was gathered from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712 with 128 Mbytes of memory, operating in a multi-user university department. Users engaged in diverse tasks, such as internet access, file editing, and CPU-intensive programs.

Being an aspiring data scientist, I aim to establish a linear equation for predicting 'usr' (the percentage of time CPUs operate in user mode). Your goal is to analyze various system attributes to understand their influence on the system's 'usr' mode.
